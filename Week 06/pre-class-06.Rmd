1. Read the source code for each of the following three functions, puzzle out what they do, and then brainstorm better names.

```
# naming the f1 function matchedPrefix because it takes a string and prefix, and based on the number of characters in prefix value, determines if the prefix matches the prefix of the string.

matchedPrefix <- function(string, prefix) {
  substr(string, 1, nchar(prefix)) == prefix
}

#renaming f2 as removeLastElement, since it removes the last element.
removeLastElement <- function(x) {
  if (length(x) <= 1) return(NULL)
  x[-length(x)]
}

#renaming function f3 replicateNTimes because it uses the rep function to replicate y the length of x times.
replicateNTimes <- function(x, y) {
  rep(y, length.out = length(x))
}
```

2. Compare and contrast rnorm() and MASS::mvrnorm(). How could you make them more consistent?


3. Use `lapply()` and an anonymous function to find the coefficient of variation (the standard deviation divided by the mean) for all columns in the mtcars dataset. 

4. Use vapply() to:
    a. Compute the standard deviation of every column in a numeric data frame.
    b. Compute the standard deviation of every numeric column in a mixed data frame. (Hint: youâ€™ll need to use vapply() twice.)
